      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Kīlauea is a shield volcano and one of the five main volcanos located on the island of Hawaiʻi. It’s one of the most active volcanoes in the world, typically having non-explosive lava effusions, although explosive eruptions have occurred, such as the notable 2018 eruption. The volcano has a large significance in Native Hawaiian culture, as it’s considered to be the home of the goddess Pele and is central to several stories and traditions.
      Kīlauea is located within Volcanoes National Park and is monitored closely by the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (HVO), which puts out daily updates.
