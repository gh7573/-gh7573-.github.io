           <td>An eruption that lasted 88 days opened at least 24 vents in and around lower Puna. The lava flows covered about 6-miles of public roads and triggered evacuations for much of the area of lower Puna. 21 houses were destroyed.</td>

           <td>This eruption lasted 35 years total , separated into 61 episodes of activity. During an eruption in March 1990, lava inundated the town of Kalapana in Puna, burying structures in tens of feet of lava. When the eruption ended, lava had covered 144 km2  and reshaped the coast southeast of Kīlauea.</td>

           <td>Lower East Rift Zone Eruption</td>
           <td>In the beginning of May 2018, a lower east rift zone eruption occurred, causing magma to drain from Kīlauea’s summit crater. One day after lava erupted to the surface next to the lower-east rift zone, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake dilated the rift zone, and more lava began to emerge in the residential subdivision of Leilani estates. At the end of May, the draining of magma from the summit caldera caused a collapse of summit’s caldera floor. When the eruption ended, over 700 structures had been destroyed.</td>
